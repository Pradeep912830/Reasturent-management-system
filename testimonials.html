                <h2>Amazing Food</h2>
                    <p>We had Degustation menu here. Ambience was great. It was all Indian Italian German fusion food. Few items were extraordinary, few were not so good..</p>

                <h2>Cozy Ambiance</h2>
                    <p>Tresind resonates royalty - we had planned out Anniversary lunch here and we were super happy to have chosen the place.
                         The way they treat diners is fantastic and with each they explain their dishes is again exemplary. 
                         The taste menu concept is a hit, although the portions look small but by the your course is complete you are too full.</p>

                <h2>Exceptional Service</h2>
                    <p>The place is an excellent restaurant. The food is great, one can have drinks and the service is good.
                        The asparagus, water chestnut dish was delicious.
                        The dumplings were all good.</p>

                <h2>Rajeev</h2>
                <h2>Quick Service</h2>
                    <p>Loved the service and the way of serving the food. Some of the recommendations by the waiter were a miss.
                         Although, tofu which I am not a great fan of was amazing.
                        We had some problems with a mocktail which was replaced even though we never asked for it.</p>

                <h2>Memorable Experience</h2>
                    <p>My first and only experience of Goan food so I may not be the best judge, however everything we ordered was very tasty and full of flavour.
                         The breads were the stand out for me along with the guava cheesecake</p>
